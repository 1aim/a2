HTTP/2 Apple Push Notification Service for Rust

# DOES NOT WORK YET

This is aiming to be a complete refactoring of an apple push notification
client. This is here to test different ways of building an api for the new
client. This will work when the http2 support lands to hyper. You can monitor
the progress in the [h2 crate](https://github.com/carllerche/h2/) and [hyper
crate](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper).

If you want to help here, please comment about the ergonomy and possible bugs in
the API.
